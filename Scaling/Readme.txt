The added .docx file contains a table displaying the results of weak scaling of time results, or simply put,the time it took several different implementations of a program, that was ran in a cluster, to calculate a specific integration of an Area under a Curve. This cluster used from 1 to up to 6 nodes, that were set to use different amounts of processors (first 1 then 2, each). It is important to note that the program used a different amount of Rectangles in the integration, depending onthe number of nodes and processors implemented in each execution. Lastly, the different implementations of the program include:- Serial- OpenMP- MPI- Hybrid (OpenMP and MPI)
