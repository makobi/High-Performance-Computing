Area-Under The Curve:
This is an adaptation of the Area-Under the Curve program provided by BCCD. In this program instead of calculating the area under the curve of the function x^2 we calculate the area under the curve of e^(-x). 

Included are a Makefile that produces area.c-serial and area.c-mpi-openmp using area.c. area.c-serial finds the area serialy and area.c-mpi-openmp finds the area using nodes and threads.
 
How to Build:
  $ make 

How To Run:
  To run a program (e.g. hybrid) with a domain from 0.0 to 10.0 and with 
  100000000 rectangles, use: qsub area.hybrid.qsub

  To run a program (e.g. serial) with the default left x-boundary of the
  domain and 10.0 as the right x-boundary of the domain with 
  100000000 rectangles, use: qsub area.serial.qsub
